<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. My name is Yu Jiang. I am currently a Software Developer of Simulink
Control Design at MathWorks.</p>

<p>
Prior to joining the company, I lived in the New York City for five years and
obtained a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from New York University in May 2014.
During my PhD, I made some contributions to Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP)
for nonlinear control design. The bulk of my research work has been
included in the book "Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming", written by me and my
PhD Thesis advisor.
</p>

<p>
I have broad interests in numerical methods in differential equaitons,
controls, and optimization. I am also developing my hobby in robotics. Please feel
free to reach out to me if you are interested in any part of my research work.
</p>
