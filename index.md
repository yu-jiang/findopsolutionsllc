# About Me
Hello. My name is Yu Jiang. I am currently the Controls Tech Lead at <a href="http://www.isee.ai">isee ai</a>, 
an autonomous trucking startup out of MIT. Prior to joining the company, I worked at <a href="http://www.clearmotion.com">ClearMotion</a> and <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>. 

I lived in the New York City for five years and
obtained a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from New York University in May 2014.
During my PhD, I made some contributions to Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP)
for nonlinear control design. The bulk of my research work has been
included in the book "Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming", co-authored by me and my
PhD Thesis advisor.

I have broad interests in numerical methods in differential equations,
controls, and optimization. I am also developing my hobby in robotics. Please feel
free to reach out to me if you are interested in any part of my research work.
