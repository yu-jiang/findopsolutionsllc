<h2 id="sample-projects">Sample Projects</h2>
<p>Here is list of selected projects I worked on for both my full-time employers and clients. For the sake of confidentiality, I will provide only the minimum information.</p>
<h3 id="operating-point-search-on-a-simscape-model-of-a-backhoe">Operating point search on a Simscape model of a backhoe</h3>
<p>This was the major cross-team application project I participated at MathWorks. The client makes backhoe machines and needed enhanced feature in Simulink Control Design to effectively trim the model (i.e., find the operating point). I led the work on reformulating the optimization problem in model trimming and developed the enhanced features. See <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/steady-state-simulation-with-projection-based-trim-optimizer.html">MathWorks Example: Steady-State Simulation with Projection-Based Trim Optimizer</a> that illustrates this feature.</p>
<h3 id="low-speed-truck-trailer-planning-and-control">Low-speed truck-trailer planning and control</h3>
<p>As the tech lead in controls at ISEE AI, I prototyped the first version of control systems (speed regulation, steering, and gear shifting) for autonomous yard trucks. I also designed the first interface between planner and controller. See <a href="https://www.isee.ai">ISEE AI&rsquo;s official website</a> for video footages of the company&rsquo;s yard trucks operating in the real world.</p>
<p>(Note: I left ISEE AI in April 2020. I am not subject to any non-compete restrictions.)</p>
<h3 id="preview-suspension-control-roadmotion">Preview suspension control (RoadMotion)</h3>
<p>This has been my major focus at ClearMotion. We collected road surface data and use that for proactive active suspension control. See <a href="https://www.clearmotion.com/roadmotion/">The RoadMotion Project</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="torque-vectoring-optimization-and-control">Torque vectoring optimization and control</h3>
<p>The client is making a certain type of vehicles that can distribute individual torques to different wheels. I helped with formulating it into an optimazation problem to achieve optimal torque vectoring and implemented a real-time solver for it.</p>
<h3 id="acc-controller-design-for-otr-trucks">ACC controller design for OTR trucks</h3>
<p>The client is making electrical over-the-road trucks, and the scope of the consulting work is to prototype the first version of an adaptive cruise controller through iterations between simulation and analyzing vehicle testing data.</p>
<h3 id="simscape-modeling-and-mbd-design">Simscape modeling and MBD design</h3>
<p>The client is making excavator-like heavy equipment for mining purpose. The work is to provide training, guidance, and trouble-shooting on simscape modeling regarding the hydraulic and mechanical components of the system. Also, training on model-based-design workflow with <a href="https://www.speedgoat.com">Speedgoat</a> is provided.</p>
