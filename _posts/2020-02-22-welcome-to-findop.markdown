Findop Solutions LLC is a consulting company founded in early 2020 by me, Yu Jiang. I am a controls engineer (or more broadly, an applied mathematician) based in the Greater Boston Area, MA. I hold a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering (Control Theory) from the New York University. Prior to starting this company, I worked at MathWorks developing Simulink Control Design Toolbox, at ClearMotion Inc. developing intelligent active suspension control algorithms, and at ISEE Inc. leading the controls team.

At Findop Solutions LLC, I specialize in converting deep mathematical/control/optimization theories into practical and innovative solutions for robotics systems. Please contact me if you are seeking consulting in projects related to control/optimization, machine learning, or applied mathematics in general. Thanks for stopping by!
