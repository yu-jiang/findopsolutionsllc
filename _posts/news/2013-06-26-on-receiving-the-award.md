It has been a great honor and privilege to receive the Shimemura Young Author Award few hours ago at the award ceremony of the 9th Asian Control Conference. It might be the best award I could ever win with my mediocre intelligence and research ability. Therefore, I am excited and thankful.

The other three great young authors who are also in the finalist have done excellent work. I respect them very much and I do appreciate the opportunity to compete with them. I wouldn't be able to win without the luck I had.

Receiving this award means my research work in the past four years has been accepted by, at least a small part of, the academia. It really gives me the sense of accomplishment, after reminding me the days and nights that I devoted into my research work. I thank my advisor, Prof Jiang, and my MS Thesis advisor, Prof Huang, for always setting a high standard for my work, and encouraging me to pursuit for excellency.   

I have been so lucky to choose research as my career. Although this road is tough, not only because I need to compete with numerous people who are smarter than me, but also I sometimes feel frustrated because of my lack of creativity. However, the joy brought by doing research is remarkable. It always excites me when I made something new, or solved some difficult problems. I enjoy that kind of joy, even if it only lasts for a few seconds. 

I give my thank to Poly's Toastmasters club. I thank them for teaching me systematically the way to give a good presentation. I am far away from being a good speaker and communicator, but after joining in this club for a year, my commutation and presentation skills have been improved. Although I did not fully utilize all the skills in my presentation this time, I did show the audience my confidence and passion as a researcher. I will keep sharpening my skills from this club, and I do encourage all the PhD students at my school to join in.

Tomorrow morning I will be leaving for Boston, and continue my internship at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs. This summer means a lot to me and my wife, because many things are changing. But I am positive about all these changes.

Finally, I thank all the people who have been caring for me and supporting me.
