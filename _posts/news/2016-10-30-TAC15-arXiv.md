There is a typo found in Theorem 3.3 4) in my publication "Global adaptive dynamic programming for continuous-time nonlinear systems," IEEE-TAC, 2015, where "...closed-loop system (1) and (15) ..." should be replaced by "...closed-loop system (1) and (7) ...". Same issue occured in Theorem 4.3 5). This has been fixed in the [arXiv version] (http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0020).

Please note that these two conclusions are not used anywhere in the paper, and therefore they in no way affect the validity of the main algorithms developed in the paper. Please [email me](yu.jiang@nyu.edu) for any related questions.

I would like to thank Zhenhui Xu and Prof. Tielong Shen from Sophia University, Japan, for carefully reading this paper and pointing out the typos.
