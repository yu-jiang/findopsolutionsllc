I came back from Boston to NYC last Saturday, and the new semester has started.

I have had a wonder summer at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) in Boston. Besides the research experiences I gained in the industrial lab, I also made many friends with interns from other top universities across the country, and I learnt a lot from them. We organized our reading group on optimization and met on a weekly basis. Thanks to the inspiration from these smart people, I not only finished the assignment from the company but also have come up with a few new ideas on my main research topic. I am so grateful to have had this opportunity to spend a wonderful summer time there.

Starting from this semester, I am in my fifth year as a PhD student at POLY. Hopefully, I can contribute more to the theory of robust adaptive dynamic programming and its applications, and keep enjoying my life as a researcher.
