<h2 id="simulink-operating-point-search">Simulink operating point search</h2>
<p>This was the major cross-team R&amp;D project I participated at MathWorks. The client makes backhoe machine and needed enhanced feature in Simulink control design to effectively trim the model (i.e., find the operating point). I led the work on reformulating the optimization problem in model trimming and developed the enhanced features. See the two new options <code>graddescent-proj</code> and <code>lsqnonlin-proj</code> in <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/findopoptions.html">MathWorks Documentation</a></p>
<h2 id="truck-trailer-planning-and-control">Truck-trailer planning and control</h2>
<p>As the tech lead in controls at ISEE AI, I prototyped the first version of control systems (speed regulation, steering, and gear shifting) for autonomous yard trucks. I also designed the first interface between planner and controller. See <a href="https://www.isee.ai">ISEE AI&rsquo;s official website</a> for more details.</p>
<p>(Note: I left ISEE AI in April 2020. There is no non-compete restrictions.)</p>
<h2 id="preview-suspension-control">Preview Suspension Control</h2>
<p>This has been my major focus at Clearmotion. We collected road surface data and use that for feedforward control of active suspension control. See <a href="https://www.clearmotion.com/roadmotion/">The RoadMotion Project</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="torque-vectoring">Torque vectoring</h2>
<p>The client is making a certain type of vehicles that can distribute individual torques to different wheels. I helped formulated an optimazation problem to achieve optimal torque vectoring and implemented a real-time solver for it.</p>
<h2 id="acc-controller-design-for-otr-trucks">ACC Controller Design for OTR Trucks</h2>
<p>The client is making electrical over-the-road trucks, and the scope of the consulting work is to prototype the first version of a adaptive cruise controller from scratches.</p>
<h2 id="simscape-modeling-and-mbd-design">Simscape modeling and MBD design</h2>
<p>The client is making excavator-like heavy equipment for mining purpose. The work is to provide training and guidance on simscape modeling on the hydraulic cylindar and on simscape multibody. Also, training on model-based-design workflow with speedgoat is provided.</p>
